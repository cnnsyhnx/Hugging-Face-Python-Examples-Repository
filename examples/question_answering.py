    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural 
    intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field 
    of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and 
    takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. The term "artificial intelligence" 
    had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display "human" cognitive skills 
    that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving". This definition 
    has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and 
    acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.
